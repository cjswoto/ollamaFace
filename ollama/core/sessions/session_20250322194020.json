      "content": "\nDark Wind Fantasy is a game or setting that features dark winds as a major element of the world. Dark winds are powerful and dangerous forces that can instant death to characters who do not know how to seek shelter from them. This training will teach characters how to find natural shelters as well as construct different types of shelters in various terrain.\n\nIn terms of racial attributes, dark tabbies have a bonus in speed and perception due to their orientation towards working at night or in dark areas. They are also known for being loyal friends and formidable enemies."

      "content": "Based on the provided context, it appears that the game system is a role-playing game with a complex character progression and advancement system. The title system determines the station of a character, which affects various aspects such as racial advancement, attribute development, innate abilities, and more.\n\nThe system also has different character types, each with unique methods of adventuring (e.g., combat training, using runes or personal spells), attribute and skill bonuses that are unlocked for each level gained in a given character type. However, if a character changes their type before achieving certain milestones, they will lose experience points learned in the previous type.\n\nThe context does not provide information on how to play the game system, but it suggests that there are various disciplines or specializations (e.g., DETECT TRAPS, RAJACK TRAINING, SURVIVAL) that can be developed through practice and achievement of certain goals. The racial attribute bonuses and modifiers (e.g., SPD, INT, LUCK, VISION) also seem to play a crucial role in determining the character's abilities and capabilities.\n\nWithout further information or context, it is difficult to provide more specific guidance on how to use the game system. However, I can suggest that players should familiarize themselves with the different character types, disciplines, and racial attributes to maximize their chances of success in the game."
