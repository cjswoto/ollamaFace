      "content": "Question: Can you summarize key points about cats from the web search and additional common knowledge? Certainly! Here are some important facts about cats based on a combination of provided results and general understanding:\n\n1. Domestication Origins - The domestic cat (Felis catus) is believed to have been first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC, making it one of humanity's oldest companions. Cats were initially valued for controlling rodents and as a source of food before becoming cherished pets or farm helpers.\n   \n2. Species Status - The cat is considered to be the only domesticated species within its family Felidae, which includes larger carnivorous mammals like lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars etc. Domestic cats are small and typically weigh between 4-17 pounds (2-8 kg).\n   \n3. Behavior - Cats can exhibit a variety of behaviors including territorial marking with urine or scratch marks on furniture when unneutered/unspayed, as well as playing an integral part in pest control by preying upon rodents and other small creatures around human habitats.\n   \n4. Sensitivity to Catnip - Interestingly, only about 50%-70% of cats are sensitive to catnip (a herb from the mint family), which contains nepetalactone that induces a euphoric and playful state in affected felines when consumed.\n   \nIn addition to these points: Cats communicate through body language, such as tail positions or ear movements; they often exhibit grooming behaviors like licking themselves clean; cats generally have retractable claws for hunting but also use them for climbing and defense in some cases (although declawing is a controversial practice); they are known to purr when content, knead on soft surfaces as an expression of comfort or gratitude, and many domestic cat owners recognize their companion animals' ability to form deep bonds with humans.\n   \nPlease note that these summarized points draw from the web search results provided but also incorporate broader knowledge about cats in human society for a well-rounded perspective on this common household pet."
